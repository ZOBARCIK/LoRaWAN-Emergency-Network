26/03/2025

after many commits and heart breakes, I finished the gateway board, tho I had to split the transciever board by module type because kicad is a bitch and will try to route around the rule zone even if it takes like 10km of copper trace or smth

type 2 and 3 transcievers are incomplete, rest is done
