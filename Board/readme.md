boards are done

1 gateway board for concentrator module, featuring a female sma connector and extra debug holes for esp32

3 transciever boards for different type of lora packets

--possible improvements
instead of through hole lora components, solder the chips directly onto board for production. also could find esp32 dev modules without presoldered pins and do the same
